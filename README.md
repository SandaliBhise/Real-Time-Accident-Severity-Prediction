# Real-Time-Accident-Severity-Prediction
This project involves creating a real-time machine learning system to predict road accident severity using historical and live data, such as weather, traffic control status, and road conditions. The goal is to help emergency responders allocate resources effectively, reducing mortality rates in severe accidents by improving response times.
